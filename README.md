# Image and preferences of the aliens:
* It is difficult to imagine how would aliens look like as noone has ever seen them but I have tried to generate some images of aliens with stable diffusion network. Here are some images:

# Dataset observation:
1. What is image captioning?
   Is the prediction of caption for a given image. Image captioning is describing images to people, generating text description to an image. It involves both CV and NLP as language models. 
2. Why people are working on it?
   Because image captioning can help people to do many real-world applications, such as image search, as an example, by providing a description of visual content in order to clearly understand the context.
3. What is the main principle of the task?
   Image captioning is used both for NLP and CV tasks such as image classification, image detection etc. The basic principle after this is usage of Vision Transformer for computer vision tasks. The idea is that Vision Transformer architecture splits the image into fized-size patches, which are flattened and after that lower- dimensional embeddings are created from these patches.
